/* 

Example 1:
Input: s = "1001"
Output: 2
Explanation: We change s[1] to 1 and s[3] to 0 to get string "1100".
It can be seen that the string "1100" is beautiful because we can partition it into "11|00".
It can be proven that 2 is the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.

Example 2:
Input: s = "10"
Output: 1
Explanation: We change s[1] to 1 to get string "11".
It can be seen that the string "11" is beautiful because we can partition it into "11".
It can be proven that 1 is the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.

Example 3:
Input: s = "0000"
Output: 0
Explanation: We don't need to make any changes as the string "0000" is beautiful already.
