/*

Example 1:
Input: word = "abcde"
Output: "1a1b1c1d1e"

Explanation:
Initially, comp = "". Apply the operation 5 times, choosing "a", "b", "c", "d", and "e" as the prefix in each operation.
For each prefix, append "1" followed by the character to comp.

Example 2:
Input: word = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaabb"
Output: "9a5a2b"

Explanation:
Initially, comp = "". Apply the operation 3 times, choosing "aaaaaaaaa", "aaaaa", and "bb" as the prefix in each operation.
For prefix "aaaaaaaaa", append "9" followed by "a" to comp.
For prefix "aaaaa", append "5" followed by "a" to comp.
For prefix "bb", append "2" followed by "b" to comp.
