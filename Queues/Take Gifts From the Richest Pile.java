Example 1:
Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4
Output: 29
Explanation: 
The gifts are taken in the following way:
- In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.
- Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
- After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.
- Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.
The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.

Example 2:
Input: gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: 
In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile. 
That is, you can't take any pile with you. 
So, the total gifts remaining are 4.
